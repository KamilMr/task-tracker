> This project runs a task tracker in the terminal using Node.js. Built with Node.js for everyone.

# Welcome
Welcome to everyone reading this document! I am working on a small module to track tasks using Node.js. It is "designed" to run in the terminal. I think those people will be interested in this project who like using Nodejs and don't like to switch between browser and the terminal. I am one of those persons. Working inside neovim and terminal I like to spend as much time as possible there. Alos I realy would love to have tracker that would track what I am working on but also would have autocomplete and I would love to controle it usign keybindings. So here is the reason and the goal for me. 

Feel free to join me in working on this module. It is an early stage at the moment, feel free to contact me and lets work togetter. I am so excited. 

Latter I am planning to synchronise this project with track.toggle.com, but will see how it goes.
