> This project runs a task tracker in the terminal using Node.js. Built with Node.js for everyone.

# Welcome
I am working on a small module to track tasks using Node.js, specifically designed to run in the terminal. This project will appeal to those who enjoy using Node.js and the terminal and prefer not to switch between the browser and the terminal. I am one of those people; working inside Neovim and the terminal, I like to spend as much time as possible there.

I would love to have a tracker that not only tracks what I am working on but also offers autocomplete and can be controlled using keybindings. This is both the reason and the goal for me.

Feel free to join me in working on this module. It is in the early stages, so please contact me, and let's work together. I am so excited.

Later, I plan to synchronize this project with track.toggle.com, but we will see how it goes.
